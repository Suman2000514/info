        After a successful U-19 World T20 campaign in 2016, when he took 14 wickets including a 5-for against the clueless Irish batsmen, Lamichhane shone bright in the WCL Championship as well, and once again, in 2018, did well in the Division two tournament, ending up as the man of the tournament of the event in Namibia,
